# codefundo-project-repo
We are building an app that will enable a user to login to a portal using biometrics and then be able to cast a vote which will in-turn be a data element in a blockchain.

The process is as follows-
- The user will log into the app using an ID (preferably Aadhar/Voter ID) and password.
- This will bring him to the facial authentication system, which will further up the security.
- Next, the person will be presented with the options he can vote for.
- After the voting has ended and poll results are out, the user will then be provided analytics about the party that won and the impact that his vote had.

The analytics will contain the following parts -
- 5 sectors - Agriculture, Water and Sanitation, Education, Health, Employment.
- The data of the winning party in these elections will then be showcased as what amount of work has been done previously in the above sectors by this party and how it is expected to be in the forthcoming years.
- By this, we are enabling the user to know the power of his vote.

Thank you
